# ElectroWorld

ElectroWorld is designed to address some of the very common but significant concerns of a students during this pandemic time. The education system has faced an unprecedented health crisis that has shaken up its foundation.  These events have sparked the digital transformation of higher education and challenged its ability to respond promptly and effectively. To solve this issue, we are here with our project which helps a student sitting in front of laptop to visualize what he/she is studying and think out of box. In this project we used Augmented reality to give students a feel of practical implementation of what they are studying.
